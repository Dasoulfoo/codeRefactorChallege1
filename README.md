## CSS Section tags
looking through the HTML I noticed that some of the div tags should be replaced with section tags because the content is grouped and the div was not conveying any special meaning to the content
 
 ### CSS Nav element
 looking through the css file i saw some div tags that could be easily replaced with a nav elements, so i went and switched a few of those out
 
 #### CSS Main Element
 i noticed that one of the content elements could be replaced with a main element because it was the main content of the section
 
 ##### CSS Service Tag elements
 instead of search engine optimization i switched it out with a service element because it was providing a service to a couole similar elements so consolidation could occur and so Horiseon didnt have to work on each individual Image element


# HTML

# HTML Main element
by gettig rid of the Div tag and replacing it with a section ID then was able to give it a class tag of service which was consolidated in CSS and properly apply service to everything with that class tag

## HTML Footer
i replaced the Div class footer because the footer was not coveying any special meaning to the content
